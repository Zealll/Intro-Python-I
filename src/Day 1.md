help(maybe an arra, or string here, or whatever you want help with)

Pyhon Arrays are called lists

.length = len(arrName)

for loop = for i in a: // for i in a range(5): range(len(a)-1, 0, -1) reverse loop (first for start, second for end, third for decrementing)

dot notation: 
```e = {
  'foo': 12,
  'bar': [1,2,3]
} ```

e[foo] gets the "foo" property


```for i in e:
	print(f'key: {i}, value: {e[i]}')```

shows the elements of arrays - e.items()


LIST COMPREHENSIONS

```array.push() = array.append()```

JS Logic
	```nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	evens = []
	for i in nums:
		if i % 2 == 0
			evens.append(i)```

Python Logic 
	```nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
	evens = [ n for n in nums if n % 2 == 0]
```

Tuple  -  IF we put something in parenthesis, it will be like an Array(list) but it will be immutable EX: a = ('foobar', 12) we can treat this like an array
